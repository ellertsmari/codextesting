This is a repository where Codex will choose the best tools it can use to create a roguelike game

## Running the game

This project contains a minimal roguelike implemented with [tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod).

```bash
python roguelike.py
```

Arrow keys move the player `@` through randomly generated rooms.
